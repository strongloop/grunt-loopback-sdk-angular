## Overview

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.2`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before,
be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
guide, as it explains how to create

use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install
this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-loopback-sdk-angular --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile
with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-loopback-sdk-angular');
```
